# Forest Shopify Headless Template

This Shopify template is designed to be used with [Forest Shopify](https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest-shopify). It provides a completely empty Shopify
theme with just the user account pages set up (log in, password, address, etc.).

The theme will redirect all requests that don't match one of these user account pages back to the host app
running Forest Shopify.
