# Forest Shopify Headless Template

This Shopify template is designed to be used with [Forest Shopify](https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest-shopify). It provides a completely empty Shopify
theme with just the user account pages set up (log in, password, address, etc.). This template is only required if the client has enabled user accounts
within the Shopify settings.

The theme will redirect all requests that don't match one of these user account pages back to the host app running Forest Shopify.

You're expected to clone and edit this template to match the basic styles of your host app. In particular you'll want to edit the `header`
and `footer` sections, and customize the `customers/account` templates, as well as the `gift_card` template.
